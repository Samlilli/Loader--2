Loader #
=========

The second in a series of CSS3/Sass based loaders.

Use the Sass file to customise the loader. The variables include:
```

$text_color: white; //Changes loader text colour
$border_color: white; //Changes the border colour of the boxes
$anim_duration: 3s; //Changes how long the animation takes to cycle

```
All the loaders are open source as long as the references to me are kept in the css file. Enjoy!
