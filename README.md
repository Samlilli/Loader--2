Loader #1
=========

The first in a series of CSS3/Sass based loaders.

Use the Sass file to customise the loader. The variables include:
```
  $text_color: white; //Changes colour of the 'Loading...' text
  $stick_color: white; //Changes the colour of all sticks
  $stick_length: 30px; //Changes length of all sticks
  $stick_distance: -8px; //Changes distance between sticks (will need editing after 32px)
```
All the loaders are open source as long as the references to me are kept in the css file. Enjoy!
